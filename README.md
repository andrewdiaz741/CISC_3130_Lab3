# CISC_3130_Lab3

# Problem Description

A record label executive received text files that contain the top streamed music artists during certain weeks. It just so happens that this imaginary VIP client has a thing for alphabetized lists and wants to see the artist names in alphabetical order. Since you learned about linked lists in class, you should know how to create and work with a similar structure here.

You can probably take the array from the previous lab activity (Lab 2), which is a truncated version of the raw data, and insert artist names into a sorted linked list.

You may also create your own classes, or you may use the example classes below to start with to create your custom sorted list ofÂ `TopStreamingArtists`.
